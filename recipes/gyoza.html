    <h2>If you don't have gyoza in your freezer, do some yourself.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Dipping Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chili-garlic sauce/li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Gyoza:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups ground pork/li>
            <li>½ cup finely chopped leeks, white and light green parts only</li>
            <li>2 medium mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Japanese rice wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce/li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper/li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages dumpling wrappers/li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and chili sauce in a small mixing bowl for dipping sauce. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine pork, leeks, mushrooms, garlic, rice wine, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well to form a uniform mixture.</li>
        <li>Take one round dumpling wrapper and put 2 tablespoons of the pork mixture on 1/2 of the wrapper. Leave approximately 1/8 inch space from the end of the dumpling. Using a brush or your finger, apply a thin coat of water all along the open space. Fold the wrapper over and push down, so the two sides get "glued" together and form a half moon. Use a fork to pinch down on the edges of the half moon to seal. Repeat to make remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Place the dumplings into the pan in one layer; do not overcrowd. Cook the dumplings for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Without flipping the dumplings, pour about 4 tablespoons of water into the pan and cover immediately. Allow the dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated and the meat inside has cooked, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and pour remaining tablespoon of oil into the pan and let the dumplings crisp up from the bottom; do not flip-gyoza should only be crisp on one side and steamed on the other. Place the dumplings browned-side up on a plate. Repeat with remaining dumplings and more oil as necessary. Serve with the dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
